## 2025-01-15: Defer SFZ Integration

### The Problem
Initial plan included full SFZ sampler support in Phase 1, but this was blocking UI/UX development. SFZ parsing is complex and the audio engine wasn't mature enough.

### The Decision
Move SFZ support to Phase 2, focus Phase 1 on core editing UI and project structure. This allows faster iteration on user experience.

### The Implementation
```swift
// Simplified audio architecture
class AudioEngineService {
	// Phase 1: Basic structure
	// Phase 2: Add DLS Synth
	// Phase 3: Add SFZ support
}
```

### The Results
- 3x faster UI development
- More stable alpha build
- Clearer development phases
- Better foundation for audio features

### Lessons Learned
- Don't let perfect audio be the enemy of good UI
- Phased approach reduces complexity
- Users can test workflow without audio

## 2025-01-18: Platform-Specific Split Views

### The Problem
VSplitView and HSplitView crashed on iOS and tvOS. Initial attempt at unified layout code failed across platforms.

### The Decision
Implement platform conditionals with appropriate fallbacks for each OS.

### The Implementation
```swift
#if os(macOS)
	VSplitView {
		content()
		Divider()
		inspector()
	}
#else
	VStack(spacing: 0) {
		content()
		Divider()
		inspector()
	}
#endif
```

### The Results
- All platforms now work correctly
- Native feel on each platform
- Minimal code duplication
- Clear platform boundaries

### Lessons Learned
- Don't force desktop paradigms on mobile
- Platform conditionals are your friend
- Test early on all target platforms

## 2025-01-22: SwiftData over Core Data

### The Problem
Need persistent storage for projects, tracks, and regions. Core Data felt heavyweight for the modern Swift app.

### The Decision
Use SwiftData for all persistence, leveraging modern Swift features.

### The Implementation
```swift
@Model
class Project {
	var id = UUID()
	var name: String
	var tracks: [Track]
	// Clean, Swift-native syntax
}
```

### The Results
- 50% less boilerplate code
- Better Swift integration
- Type-safe queries
- Easier relationship management

### Lessons Learned
- Modern Apple frameworks reduce complexity
- Type safety prevents many bugs
- SwiftData relationships need manual array handling in Lists

## 2025-01-25: Glassmorphic Design System

### The Problem
Need professional, modern look that follows Apple's design language while standing out.

### The Decision
Implement liquid glass (glassmorphic) design with ultraThinMaterial throughout.

### The Implementation
```swift
.background(.ultraThinMaterial)
.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16))
.shadow(color: .black.opacity(0.1), radius: 8, y: 2)
```

### The Results
- Cohesive visual design
- Platform-appropriate adaptations
- Professional appearance
- Good performance (with optimizations)

### Lessons Learned
- Blur effects need platform consideration
- tvOS needs high contrast variants
- iOS benefits from reduced blur in low power

## 2025-01-28: Placeholder Audio Engine

### The Problem
Complex audio implementation blocking UI testing and development.

### The Decision
Create placeholder AudioEngineService with proper API surface but no implementation.

### The Implementation
```swift
class AudioEngineService: ObservableObject {
	@Published var isPlaying = false
	// API defined, implementation deferred
}
```

### The Results
- UI fully testable without audio
- Clear API contract for Phase 2
- Transport controls can be wired up
- No audio complexity in Phase 1

### Lessons Learned
- Interfaces before implementation
- UI/Logic separation enables parallel work
- Placeholders must have realistic APIs
